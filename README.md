# Proof

A very basic template for proofing type with InDesign. Intended for use with generated sample text from [Word-O-Mat](https://github.com/ninastoessinger/word-o-mat).

__[Download](https://github.com/kennethormandy/proof/archive/master.zip)__

## Considerations

- __Includes space for basic information__ so your instructors and mentors know what they are looking at
- __Automatically updates the date and time__ on print or export so you don’t get confused about what proof you’re reviewing
- __Includes reference glyph section__ so you can mark all corrections in one place

## Contributing
